# anything-to-okf — Convert Any File Format to Open Knowledge Format

**Transform your documents, data, and code into a beautiful, linked knowledge bundle — no vendor lock-in, pure markdown.**

Convert **any file format** (CSV, PDF, Word, JSON, Markdown, code) into **Open Knowledge Format (OKF)** bundles. Automatically detect and inject cross-table relationships. Iteratively refine, evaluate quality, and incorporate feedback — all in conversation with Claude.

Perfect for:
- 📊 Building knowledge bases from mixed sources
- 🔗 Creating linked data catalogs (sales data, schemas, documentation)
- 🤖 Feeding AI agents structured, portable knowledge
- 📝 Publishing to Obsidian, MkDocs, Hugo, or git
- 🔄 Enriching existing data with AI-powered analysis

## 📦 Installation

**Prerequisite:** [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

**Option 1 — Plugin marketplace (recommended):**

```
/plugin marketplace add CAgGen/anything-to-okf
```

**Option 2 — npx (Node.js 14+ required):**

```bash
npx github:CAgcoder/anything-to-okf
```

**Option 3 — Manual:** Clone this repo and copy `SKILL.md`, `scripts/`, `references/`, `evals/` into `~/.claude/skills/anything-to-okf/`.

**Restart Claude Code** to activate.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Open Claude Code in any project directory, then:

**Step 1 — Point at your files**

```
/anything-to-okf generate
```

Claude will ask what files to convert, or you can say it directly:

```
/anything-to-okf generate my-data/orders.csv my-data/customers.json docs/schema.md
```

**Step 2 — Wait for the bundle**

The skill extracts content, detects cross-table relationships, and writes a linked OKF bundle. You'll see:

```
✅ Bundle generated: okf-bundle/ (12 concepts, 3 cross-table relationships)
```

**Step 3 — Refine in chat**

```
/anything-to-okf refine   ← "make the orders section shorter"
/anything-to-okf score    ← get a quality scorecard
/anything-to-okf enhance  ← "add that customer tier affects SLA"
/anything-to-okf export   ← prepare for Obsidian / git / Hugo
```

Plain English works too — just describe what you want and the skill figures out which command to run.

## ✨ What Makes This Different

| Aspect | knowledge-catalog | anything-to-okf |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Input formats** | BigQuery only | Any format (CSV, PDF, JSON, code…) |
| **LLM** | Google Vertex Gemini | Claude (or codex) |
| **Output** | Dataplex mdcode (vendor lock) | OKF markdown (portable) |
| **Refinement** | Interactive REPL | Conversation-driven |
| **Quality metrics** | Golden-based | Deterministic + extensible |
| **User feedback** | Proposals → override | JSON feedback fusion |
| **Architecture** | Full ADK + Dataplex | Pure Python/Bash, runs anywhere |
| **Source re-extraction** | Not needed  | Not needed ✅ |

**TL;DR:** Same power as knowledge-catalog's enrichment engine, but format-agnostic, lighter-weight, and conversation-driven inside Claude Code.

## 📋 How It Works

### **generate** — Build the bundle

Extract, deduplicate, and intelligently inject cross-table relationships.

```
Input: CSV + JSON + Markdown
  ↓
extract_concepts.py   → JSON blocks for each source
collect_concepts.py   → Deduplicate across files
aggregate_concepts.py → LLM merge pass (connect fragmented facts)
inject_shared_concepts.py → Bidirectional links
  ↓
Output: OKF bundle with auto-detected relationships
```

**Example:** A CSV with `customer_id` + a JSON schema + a doc saying "orders.customer_id → customers.id" → the FK appears in **both** orders and customers automatically.

### **refine** — Polish concepts

Free-text iteration on generated markdown — no source re-extraction.

```
User: "/anything-to-okf refine — make orders shorter"
  ↓ (loads current orders.md, calls claude with refinement request)
Output: Refined orders.md (saved, history tracked)
```

### **score** — Evaluate quality

Metrics dashboard for your bundle.

```
Structural Validity: 99/100 ✅
Concept Coverage: 12 concepts
Cross-References: 100% (all bidirectional)
Overall Score: 99/100 ✅
```

### **enhance** — Apply feedback

Incorporate domain knowledge without re-extracting.

```json
{
  "proposals": [
    {
      "concept_id": "tables/orders",
      "feedback": "Clarify that total_usd is 0.00 when refunded",
      "priority": "high"
    }
  ]
}
```

Additive only — never removes existing content.

## 🎯 Real-World Example

**Scenario:** You have sales data in three formats. You want a searchable knowledge base.

### Sources:
- `orders.csv` — 5 columns, no docs
- `customers.json` — schema with FK info
- `schema-relationships.md` — documents the 1:N relationship + revenue metric

### Commands:
```
1. /anything-to-okf generate  →  bundle: 12 concepts, FKs detected, validated ✅

2. /anything-to-okf refine    →  "shorten schema sections" (no re-extraction)

3. /anything-to-okf score     →  "98/100 ✅"

4. /anything-to-okf enhance   →  "add that tier affects SLA" → customer schema updated

5. /anything-to-okf export    →  ready to drag into Obsidian vault
```

## 📊 Feature Breakdown

### Core Capabilities

- ✅ **Format-agnostic**: CSV, JSON, PDF, Word, HTML, Markdown, code, anything
- ✅ **Cross-table concepts**: Auto-detect & bidirectionally inject relationships
- ✅ **Smart deduplication**: LLM merge pass connects fragmented facts
- ✅ **Session-based refinement**: Iterate without re-extracting sources
- ✅ **Quality evaluation**: Structural + coverage + cross-reference metrics
- ✅ **User feedback fusion**: JSON proposals → concept enhancement
- ✅ **Portable output**: Plain markdown, no vendor lock-in
- ✅ **Git-friendly**: Diffs, PRs, version history on OKF bundles

### What It Doesn't Do (By Design)

- ❌ Auto-discover from schema reflection alone (requires sources to state relationships)
- ❌ Infer cardinality beyond what sources state
- ❌ Resolve conflicting facts (picks one, logs it)

## 📖 What Is OKF?

**Open Knowledge Format** is a vendor-neutral markdown+YAML standard for knowledge bundles.

Key properties:
- **Human-readable:** Just markdown files in a directory
- **Agent-readable:** YAML frontmatter + standardized cross-links
- **Portable:** No lock-in, works with git/Obsidian/MkDocs/etc.
- **Minimal spec:** Only requires `type` field — everything else optional

Read [okf-spec.md](references/okf-spec.md) for details.
